class DFAnalyzer:
    // Private members:
    Define a hash function for the unordered_map key (pair<char, char>)
    Define an unordered_map to store the DFA's transition table
    Define a set to store the accept states
    Define a char to store the start state
    Define a bool to indicate if the DFA is valid

    // Helper function to validate instruction format
    isValidInstruction(instruction):
        If instruction length is less than 3, return false
        If first and last characters are not digits, return false
        For each character between the first and last characters:
            If the character is not a lowercase letter, return false
        Return true

    // Public methods:
    // Default constructor
    DFAnalyzer():
        Initialize DFA as invalid
        Initialize start state as undefined

    // Copy constructor
    DFAnalyzer(other):
        Copy other's transition table, accept states, start state, and isValidDFA flag

    // Assignment operator
    operator=(other):
        Assign other's transition table, accept states, start state, and isValidDFA flag to the current object

    // Destructor
    ~DFAnalyzer():
        // No dynamically allocated resources to release

    // Load DFA from a file
    Load(fileName):
        Open file with the given fileName
        If file cannot be opened, mark DFA as invalid and return
        For each line in the file:
            If line is not a valid instruction, mark DFA as invalid and return
            Extract fromState, symbols, and toState from the line
            Add transitions for each symbol in symbols
        Close the file and mark DFA as valid

    // Set start state
    SetStartState(state):
        If DFA is valid and state is a digit, set startState to state

    // Modify accept state
    ModifyAcceptState(state):
        If DFA is valid and state is a digit:
            If state is in acceptStates, remove it
            Else, add state to acceptStates

    // Check if an input string is accepted by the DFA
    IsAccepted(input):
        If DFA is not valid or start state is not defined, return false
        Set currentState to startState
        For each symbol in input:
            If symbol is not a lowercase letter, return false
            Update currentState based on the transition table
        Return true if currentState is in acceptStates, else return false

    // Convert the DFA's transition table to a string
    ToString():
        If DFA is not valid, return "Invalid DFA"
        Initialize an empty stringstream
        For each entry in the transition table:
            Add a tuple (fromState, symbol, toState) to the stringstream
        Return the stringstream's content as a string
